# Final Project Proposal 

## Introduction 
For my project I would like to look into NFT'S. More specifically, I would like to look into which NFT's are the most popular, largest in value, and owned by the most people.
An NFT, short for non-fungible token is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data that is stored on a digital ledger otherwise known as a blockchain. NFT's can consist of virtually 
anything such as ideas, physical properties, intellectual property and many other things. The first NFT was created back in 2014, however in 2021 there was a massive boom in the amount
of people who started purchasing NFT's and the amount of content creators that began to create their own NFT's, due to the rise in popularty of cryptocurrency. For many buyers now NFT's are a form of investment while also an entryway into the growing digital world. 

Exploring this dataset is something I personally find interesting being that I am just entering the NFT world both as a consumer and analyst. This dataset holds a variety of information on NFT's that could give myself and others insight into the value of such digital data. With the NFT market now being extremely saturated and popular figures promoting a new type of NFT everyday, I hope that my analysis sheds light on the future profitable NFT selections and or buying strategies being that the NFT world will continue to grow.  

## Data Source 
As of now I have one data source that I plan on using which I found on kaggle. It has a dataset of 7 million transactions of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The dataset covers April to late September 2021, spans 9,000 NFT projects, and records each transactionâ€™s sender, receiver, value, timestamp, and location in the blockchain. 

This is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/simiotic/ethereum-nft-analysis/data

## Insights and Resulting Visualizations
As stated before I would like to analyze the most popular NFT's, those largest in value, and those owned by the most people. I think I will be doing many more analysis on the different aspects of the transactions as well so that the audience can get an understanding of how to buy and sell. As of now I think that creating compositional and relationship charts will be a good start so that I am able to visualize and clean the data further in order to have multiple comprehensive visualizaions in the end that outline the important factors of finding, buying, and selling NFT's. In creating this project I ultimately hope to learn how to look through the saturated market so that my time and money is well spent.
